### What I do

Currently working as a Software Engineer Lead @ [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/). \
 _Anything_ that I post doesn't reflect the view of my employer but *my own* 

I’m a Software Engineer with a history of delivery of projects in QA, Production, and Mission Critical environments.

With proven experience in scripting, automation creation and coding on Linux based infrastructure, I integrate well in any pre-existing agile team.

What I don’t lack is the curiosity to learn and to better myself and the place where I work.\
Open to learn from the people around me as well as share my knowledge, all with the goal to reach the target in a fast, cost-effective, precise and complete manner.
