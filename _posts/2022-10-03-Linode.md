I now have moved  [my little personal website](https://lucafrancesca.me) to Linode using their most basic shared cpu vps (1core,1gb of ram, 25gb of ssd) \
and moved to a 5$7month plan.
Compared to DO the Linode expeience is a lot easier and the UX makes more sense. \
Let's see if the performances are ok.
