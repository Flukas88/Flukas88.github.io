As of now, for  [my little personal website](https://lucafrancesca.me) I'm using an digitalocean droplet with the bare minimum in the resource specs ad it's costing me round 20 EUR/month. \
I was looking around to find a simple vps service for my lil page and I found that prices for simple tasks such as mine are kinda high. \
How can someone in 2022 pay the right amount of money for a simple vps?
