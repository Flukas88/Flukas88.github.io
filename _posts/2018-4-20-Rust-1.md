Looking at a simple _Rust_ code I can definitely notice one thing.

```rust

#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    let res = adder(10,123);
    println!("{}", res);
}


fn adder(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64 {
    return a + b;
}

```

Seems subtly different from _C/C++_ but, to be honest, I quite like the change of syntax.
